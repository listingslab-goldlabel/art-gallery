In Australian English, "creek bed" refers to the channel or depression in the ground where a creek or small stream flows when it contains water. A creek is a term used for a small to medium-sized natural watercourse, often with a relatively slow flow of water. The "creek bed" is the bottom or floor of the creek, which may be dry when there's no water flowing through it or filled with water during rainy periods.
